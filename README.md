# Luyu's Blog

This is my Gatsby-powered personal website where I post my thoughts, experience and reviews. You can view demos at [luyu.blog](https://luyu.blog) (recommended) ~~, and [cly.wtf](https://cly.wtf) (also accessible but deprecated)~~.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js][nodejs] and [Yarn][yarn] on your computer.
2. Clone this repository into some location.
3. `cd` into that location, and run `yarn`. This will install all dependencies.
    * If you are suffering from instable network connections, please use a proxy or NPM mirrors nearby.
    * If Yarn cannot build some packages successfully. Make sure you have installed required build toolchains on your computer.
4. Run `yarn start` and wait a second. The website is accessible at [localhost:8000][preview].
